In this PR, you should make sure all the dependencies are up-to-date and make sure the new release's version is updated everywhere in the docs and the project files where needed. - Make sure the squashed commit message when merging this PR to master contains the words \"Prepare for release \" . For example, before releasing version 1.10.0 , this commit message should be \"Prepare for release 1.10.0\" . This is important to trigger and publish new benchmarks for the library. Release \u00b6 To release the library, you need to create a new git commit tag. This will trigger a new Travis build. The tag can be created via the command line git tag -a { version } -m \"Minor text adjustments.\" git push --tags or github UI \"Draft new Release\": https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/releases Having a tag in the commit will cause Travis to call the bintrayUpload task specified in the Gradle build scripts, which uploads the artifacts to Bintray. The artifacts have to be then promoted/published from Bintray to JCenter and/or Maven Central . See Publish workflow below for more details. Please make sure to add a section for the release in the release notes . Publish workflow \u00b6 Full build with tests, documentation publishing and Bintray upload \u00b6 ./gradlew clean build gitPublishPush bintrayUpload -Dbuild.version={version} Publish to local maven repo \u00b6 This step may be used for local test versions: ./gradlew clean install -Dbuild.version={version} If you want to review full generated pom.xml (with license, scm, developers) like it will be published, then use: ./gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal -Dbuild.version={version} where publishToMavenLocal is a task from maven-publish plugin. Publish snapshots to oss.sonatype.org \u00b6 To publish to OSS Sonatype snapshots repo the following command is used: ./gradlew clean build uploadArchives -Dbuild.version ={ version } -SNAPSHOT The -SNAPSHOT suffix is mandatory. Note : for publishing to OSS Sonatype you need to specify API User/Key (not login credentials) for OSS_USER / OSS_KEY environment variables or ossUser / ossKey Gradle build properties (the properties have precedence over environment variables). See more configuration details of the oss uploading in oss-publish.gradle file. Publish to Bintray \u00b6 Bintray documentation about the publishing process Bintray publish is performed by gradle-bintray-plugin . The artifacts are published to bintray commercetools maven repo . If you are a new developer in the project - update contributors list in maven-publish.gradle -> pomConfig -> developers . To initiate publish call: ./gradlew clean build bintrayUpload -Dbuild.version={version} NOTE : Bintray does not allow to publish snapshots thus {version} should not contain SNAPSHOT . If you wish to use snapshots, https://oss.jfrog.com account should be configured. See https://blog.bintray.com/2014/02/11/bintray-as-pain-free-gateway-to-maven-central/ for more info. To publish the artifacts to Bintray: 1. Go to https://bintray.com/commercetools/maven/commercetools-sync-java 2. Make sure you are logged in with the commercetools account. 3. You will see a notice Notice: You have 24 unpublished item(s) for this package (expiring in 6 days and 22 hours) 4. Click Publish After publishing to Bintray artifacts are available in Bintray Download but still not available in JCenter . To publish the artifacts to JCenter do the next: 1. On the version page go to the Maven Central tab. 2. Enter the commercetools Sonatype Maven Central API Key and password. 3. Click Sync and you\u2019re done! Your package should now be available in JCenter commercetools-sync-java and will be synced to Maven Central (and they usually take their time). In case of a sync problem, Bintray will automatically take care of any needed cleanup. Publish to Maven \u00b6 Publishing to Maven Central requires the following steps: Build the app and upload to Bintray (see the steps above for integration tests) Signing up the app with PGP key : for now we use Bintray's \"a stock built-in key-pair so that it can auto-sign every file you upload\" Manually release from Bintray web page to Maven Central Note : Maven Central has much stricter requirements to published artifacts, e.g. it should have mandatory POM fields (like developers list, SCM references; this is configured in the build script ) and mandatory signed by GPG key (could be performed by Bintray settings). For more info about Maven Central requirements see Requirements page.
