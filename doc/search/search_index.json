Example for Product Sync : For mapping from Product to ProductDraft the util method ProductTransformUtils.toProductDrafts should be called along with sphereClient , cache implementation( ReferenceIdToKeyCache ) and productTypes parameters. Product Sync : The productProjections endpoint is used instead of products endpoint to improve the performance of the product Sync . Changes: The callbacks of the product Sync will now work with productProjections instead of products The update action ( buildCustomUpdateActions , buildAssetsUpdateActions , buildAssetActions ) doesn't require the \"old Resource\" as parameter anymore. All update actions of products now working with ProductProjections instead of Products The method syncFrenchDataOnly has a new signature public static List<UpdateAction<Product>> syncFrenchDataOnly(@Nonnull final List<UpdateAction<Product>> updateActions, @Nonnull final ProductDraft newProductDraft, @Nonnull final ProductProjection oldProduct) The method keepOtherVariants has a new signature List<UpdateAction<Product>> keepOtherVariants( @Nonnull final List<UpdateAction<Product>> updateActions) The method mapToProductDrafts has a new signature public static List<ProductDraft> mapToProductDrafts(Nonnull final List<ProductProjection> products) The method getDraftBuilderFromStagedProduct has a new signature public static ProductDraftBuildergetDraft BuilderFromStagedProduct(@Nonnull final ProductProjection product) The method buildProductQuery has a new signature public static ProductProjectionQuery buildProductQuery() The method buildCategoryActions has a new signature public static List<UpdateAction<Product>> buildCategoryActions(@Nonnull final ProductProjection oldProduct, @Nonnull final ProductDraft newProduct) The class BaseSyncOptions has a new generics <A> , which indicate the resource type to update The class BaseSyncOptionsBuilder has a new generics <A> , which indicate the resource type to update \u2728 Enhancements (2) To improve performance of the library, We are not expanding any references in the query for the resources, Instead library fetches key-id pairs and stores in a cache to reuse them. Example for ProductSync: The util class method ProductTransformUtils.toProductDrafts will fetch key-id pairs and stores in a cache. This cache has been used to build the productDraft by resolving references. For detailed documentation refer - syncing-from-a-commercetools-project Product Sync Use the new addVariant which supports the adding assets of the new variant. #714 Support synchronization of state and customer references in product variant attributes. #715 \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Dependency Updates (1) commercetools-jvm-sdk 1.60.0 -> 1.62.0 4.0.1 - Mar 19, 2021 \u00b6 Commits | Javadoc | Jar \u2728 Enhancements (1) To avoid 414 request-URI too large error, the services are using chunking on the input list(keys or sku's) to chunk the input considering the length of the request URI and execute the query for these chunks. \u2728 Build Tools (1) Migrated from gradle v5.6.2 to v6.8.2 . \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Dependency Updates (1) Updated the following transitive dependencies to avoid vulnerability issues of previous versions: com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-cbor -> Fixed vulnerability issue for DoS attacks io.netty:netty-codec-http -> Fixed vulnerability issue for Information Disclosure org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient -> Fixed vulnerability issue for Improper Input Validation commons-codec:commons-codec -> Fixed vulnerability issue for Information Exposure 4.0.0 - Feb 26, 2021 \u00b6 Commits | Javadoc | Jar \ud83d\udea7 Breaking Changes (1) Product Sync : PriceDraft.getCustomerGroup() is changed from Reference<CustomerGroup> to ResourceIdentifier<CustomerGroup> , so as a library user you don't need to provide a key field in the id field of the Reference. (Now API and JVM SDK support ResourceIdentifiers and it supports id or key as a field). #676 \u2728 Enhancements (1) Refactored CategorySync to make it consistent with other Sync types (e.g ProductSync). #681 \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Dependency Updates (2) commercetools-jvm-sdk 1.57.0 -> 1.60.0 commercetools-java-client -> commercetools-java-client-ahc-2_5 -> Upgraded the default http client to avoid \"Runtime Access Warnings\" because of out of date netty dependencies on jvm-sdk. Note: commercetools-java-client-ahc-2_5 dependency uses async-http-client version 2.5.4 \u2728 Build Tools (1) Migrating from JCenter / Bintray to The Maven Central Repository.

Example for Product Sync : For mapping from Product to ProductDraft the util method ProductTransformUtils.toProductDrafts should be called along with sphereClient , cache implementation( ReferenceIdToKeyCache ) and productTypes parameters. Product Sync : The productProjections endpoint is used instead of products endpoint to improve the performance of the product Sync . Changes: The callbacks of the product Sync will now work with productProjections instead of products The update action ( buildCustomUpdateActions , buildAssetsUpdateActions , buildAssetActions ) doesn't require the \"old Resource\" as parameter anymore.

LineItem and TextLineItem update actions of the ShoppingLists. \u00b6 Date: 2020-11-04 Status \u00b6 Approved Context \u00b6 In a commerce application, a shopping list is a personal wishlist of a customer, (i.e. ingredients for a recipe, birthday wishes). Shopping lists hold line items of products in the platform or any other items that can be described as text line items. We have challenges to build update actions of the LineItem and TextLineItem because of the nature of the synchronization, so in this document, we will describe the reasons and constraints, mostly related to order of the items: - LineItem orders might be important, if the customer has a front end that sorts the line items with their order could mean sorting by importance. LineItems \u00b6 How to ensure line item order? \u00b6 LineItemDrafts LineItems { \"lineItems\": [ { \"sku\": \"SKU-1\", \"quantity\": 1, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } } }, { \"sku\": \"SKU-2\", \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } { \"lineItems\": [ { \"id\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"variant\": { \"sku\": \"SKU-2\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\" } ] } Analysis Draft has line items with SKU-1 and SKU-2 . In the target project line item with SKU-2 exists, so SKU-1 is a new line item. So we need to create an AddLineItem action and a Change LineItems Order of the line items SKU-1 and SKU-2 , because when we add line item with SKU-1 the order will be SKU-2 and SKU-1 . The challenge in here is, those actions can not be added in one request because we don't know the line item id of the new line item with SKU-1 , so we need to find another way to create a new line item with the right order. Proposed solution Normally, for a difference, we might do a set intersection and then calculate action for differences, but that does not make sense because we are not aware of the order from the draft. So in this case the one request could be created but we might need to remove line item with SKU-2 and line items in the draft with the given order with the line items SKU-1 and SKU-2 . { \"version\": 1, \"actions\": [ { \"action\": \"removeLineItem\", \"lineItemId\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\" }, { \"action\": \"addLineItem\", \"sku\": \"SKU-1\", \"quantity\": 1, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } } }, { \"action\": \"addLineItem\", \"sku\": \"SKU-2\", \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } Do we need to remove all line items when the order changes ? \u00b6 LineItemDrafts LineItems { \"lineItems\": [ { \"sku\": \"SKU-1\", \"quantity\": 1, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } } }, { \"sku\": \"SKU-3\", \"quantity\": 3, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-05T10:00:10.101Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-3\" } } }, { \"sku\": \"SKU-2\", \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } { \"lineItems\": [ { \"id\": \"1c38d582-2e65-43f8-85db-4d34e6cff57a\", \"variant\": { \"sku\": \"SKU-1\" }, \"quantity\": 1, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\" }, { \"id\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"variant\": { \"sku\": \"SKU-2\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\" } ] } Analysis Draft has line items with SKU-1 , SKU-3 and SKU-2 also in target project line item with SKU-1 exists in the same order, SKU-3 is a new line item, and SKU-2 needs to be in last order.

The challenge in here is, those actions can not be added in one request because we don't know the line item id of the new line item with SKU-3 , so we need to find another way to create a new line item with the right order. Also another challenge in here is about the line item with SKU-1 , as the order and data is exactly same, we need to find a better way to avoid creating unnecessary actions. Proposed solution The solution idea about the new line item and changed order is still same like in the case-1. Do we need to remove and add line item with SKU-1 ? No, it is not needed and we could start the removing and adding from the first order change. { \"version\": 1, \"actions\": [ { \"action\": \"removeLineItem\", \"lineItemId\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\" }, { \"action\": \"addLineItem\", \"sku\": \"SKU-3\", \"quantity\": 3, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-05T10:00:10.101Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-3\" } } }, { \"action\": \"addLineItem\", \"sku\": \"SKU-2\", \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } Do we need to remove and add all line items when no new line item is added or removed, just order is different ? \u00b6 LineItemDrafts LineItems { \"lineItems\": [ { \"sku\": \"SKU-2\", \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-05T10:00:10.101Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } }, { \"sku\": \"SKU-1\", \"quantity\": 1, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } } } ] } { \"lineItems\": [ { \"id\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"variant\": { \"sku\": \"SKU-1\" }, \"quantity\": 1, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\" }, { \"id\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"variant\": { \"sku\": \"SKU-2\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\" } ] } Analysis The Draft has line items with SKU-2 and SKU-1 also in target project line item with SKU-2 and SKU-1 exists but in a different order. So we need a Change LineItems Order of the line items with order SKU-2 and SKU-1 . The challenge here is about the line item order and no new line item is added or removed, just order is different, so we need to find a better way to avoid creating unnecessary actions like removing and adding back, is this possible ? Proposed solution The solution idea for the changing order with removing and adding back looks like an overhead. We know all line item ids, so change order action could be created. However, the challenge is finding an algorithm to compare and find the line item ids, and then prepare an order. The example above seems reasonable but how you would sync a case like: [SKU-1, SKU-2, SKU-3] to [SKU-3, SKU-1, SKU-4, SKU-2] , so with a different algorithm it might be done with change order [line-item-id-3, line-item-id-1, line-item-id-2] then removeLineItem SKU-2 , add back addLineItem SKU-4 , in total 3 actions. Even for this we need to remove and add back. It looks like there are more different cases, when we dig in. That's why we decided to keep the idea of removing and adding back to not have a more complex algorithm. TextLineItems \u00b6 How to ensure text line item order? \u00b6 TextLineItemDrafts TextLineItems { \"textLineItems\": [ { \"name\": { \"de\": \"name1-DE\", \"en\": \"name1-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc1-DE\", \"en\": \"desc1-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 1, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } } }, { \"name\": { \"de\": \"name2-DE\", \"en\": \"name2-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc2-DE\", \"en\": \"desc2-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } { \"textLineItems\": [ { \"id\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"name\": { \"de\": \"name2-DE\", \"en\": \"name2-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc2-DE\", \"en\": \"desc2-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\" } ] } Analysis Draft has text line items with name-1 and name-2 . In the target project text line item with name-2 exists, so name-1 is a new text line item. So we need to create an AddTextLineItem action and a Change TextLineItems Order of the text line items name-1 and name-2 , because when we add text line item with name-1 the order will be name-2 and name-1 . The challenge in here is, those actions cannot be added in one request because we don't know the text line item id of the new text line item with name-1 . We need to find another way to create a new text line item with the right order. Proposed solution Normally, for a difference, we do a set intersection and then calculate action for differences, but that does not make sense because we are not aware of the order from the draft. Before that, we need to analyse the AddTextLineItem action, because the platform is not checking if the data exist. An API user could add the exact same data multiple times. So it's impossible to know the order by just checking the differences between the resource and draft object. Also, the name of the text line item does not need to be unique as line item does. Each line item is identified by its product variant and custom fields. Luckily the platform supports changing all field (except addedAt ) of the text line items, so when an order change is needed we update the fields of the text line items. Which will look like: { \"version\": 1, \"actions\": [ { \"action\" : \"changeTextLineItemName\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"name\": { \"de\": \"name1-DE\", \"en\": \"name1-EN\" } }, { \"action\" : \"changeTextLineItemQuantity\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"quantity\" : 1 }, { \"action\" : \"setTextLineItemDescription\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc1-DE\", \"en\": \"desc1-EN\" } }, { \"action\" : \"setTextLineItemCustomField\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"name\" : \"textField\", \"value\" : \"text-1\" }, { \"action\" : \"addTextLineItem\", \"name\": { \"de\": \"name2-DE\", \"en\": \"name2-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc2-DE\", \"en\": \"desc2-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } Common \u00b6 How addedAt will be compared? \u00b6 In commercetools shopping lists API, there is no update action to change the addedAt field of the LineItem and TextLineItem , also in API it has a default value described as Defaults to the current date and time. , when it's not set in the draft, so how to compare and update this field? Proposed solution: The addedAt field will be synced only if the value provided in the line item draft, otherwise, the addedAt value will be omitted. To be able to sync it we need to remove and add this line item back with the up-to-date value. After some discussions in pull requests, we decided to not change this field. Decision \u00b6 In commercetools API, the product variant to be selected in the LineItemDraft can be specified either by its product ID plus variant ID or by its SKU. For the sync library, product variant will be matched by its SKU, if the SKU not set for a LineItemDraft, the draft will not be synced and an error callback will be triggered. Check LineItemDraft Product Variant Selection for more details. When a Change LineItems Order action is needed, the line items will be removed and added back with the order provided in the ShoppingListDraft . When a Change TextLineItems Order action is needed, the text line items will be updated with using update actions with the order provided in the ShoppingListDraft . In commercetools shopping lists API, there is no update action to change the addedAt field of the LineItem and TextLineItem , hereby we will not update the addedAt value. Consequences \u00b6 To ensure the order of the line items, we need to remove and add line items. That means a bigger payload and a performance overhead. To ensure the order of text line items, we need to calculate and update more than expected. That means a bigger payload and a performance overhead. Caveat : addedAt values not synced.","title":"2.

The example above seems reasonable but how you would sync a case like: [SKU-1, SKU-2, SKU-3] to [SKU-3, SKU-1, SKU-4, SKU-2] , so with a different algorithm it might be done with change order [line-item-id-3, line-item-id-1, line-item-id-2] then removeLineItem SKU-2 , add back addLineItem SKU-4 , in total 3 actions. Even for this we need to remove and add back. It looks like there are more different cases, when we dig in. That's why we decided to keep the idea of removing and adding back to not have a more complex algorithm.","title":"Do we need to remove and add all line items when no new line item is added or removed, just order is different ?"},{"location":"adr/0002-shopping-lists-lineitem-and-textlineitem-update-actions/#textlineitems","text":"","title":"TextLineItems"},{"location":"adr/0002-shopping-lists-lineitem-and-textlineitem-update-actions/#how-to-ensure-text-line-item-order","text":"TextLineItemDrafts TextLineItems { \"textLineItems\": [ { \"name\": { \"de\": \"name1-DE\", \"en\": \"name1-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc1-DE\", \"en\": \"desc1-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 1, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-1\" } } }, { \"name\": { \"de\": \"name2-DE\", \"en\": \"name2-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc2-DE\", \"en\": \"desc2-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:40:12.341Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] } { \"textLineItems\": [ { \"id\": \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"name\": { \"de\": \"name2-DE\", \"en\": \"name2-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc2-DE\", \"en\": \"desc2-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"id\": \"4796e155-f5a4-403a-ae1a-04b10c9dfc54\", \"obj\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" } }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } }, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\" } ] } Analysis Draft has text line items with name-1 and name-2 . In the target project text line item with name-2 exists, so name-1 is a new text line item. So we need to create an AddTextLineItem action and a Change TextLineItems Order of the text line items name-1 and name-2 , because when we add text line item with name-1 the order will be name-2 and name-1 . The challenge in here is, those actions cannot be added in one request because we don't know the text line item id of the new text line item with name-1 . We need to find another way to create a new text line item with the right order. Proposed solution Normally, for a difference, we do a set intersection and then calculate action for differences, but that does not make sense because we are not aware of the order from the draft. Before that, we need to analyse the AddTextLineItem action, because the platform is not checking if the data exist. An API user could add the exact same data multiple times. So it's impossible to know the order by just checking the differences between the resource and draft object. Also, the name of the text line item does not need to be unique as line item does. Each line item is identified by its product variant and custom fields. Luckily the platform supports changing all field (except addedAt ) of the text line items, so when an order change is needed we update the fields of the text line items. Which will look like: { \"version\": 1, \"actions\": [ { \"action\" : \"changeTextLineItemName\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"name\": { \"de\": \"name1-DE\", \"en\": \"name1-EN\" } }, { \"action\" : \"changeTextLineItemQuantity\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"quantity\" : 1 }, { \"action\" : \"setTextLineItemDescription\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc1-DE\", \"en\": \"desc1-EN\" } }, { \"action\" : \"setTextLineItemCustomField\", \"textLineItemId\" : \"24de3821-e27d-4ddb-bd0b-ecc99365285f\", \"name\" : \"textField\", \"value\" : \"text-1\" }, { \"action\" : \"addTextLineItem\", \"name\": { \"de\": \"name2-DE\", \"en\": \"name2-EN\" }, \"description\": { \"de\": \"desc2-DE\", \"en\": \"desc2-EN\" }, \"quantity\": 2, \"addedAt\": \"2020-11-04T09:38:35.571Z\", \"custom\": { \"type\": { \"key\": \"custom-type-for-shoppinglists\" }, \"fields\": { \"textField\": \"text-2\" } } } ] }","title":"How to ensure text line item order?"},{"location":"adr/0002-shopping-lists-lineitem-and-textlineitem-update-actions/#common","text":"","title":"Common"},{"location":"adr/0002-shopping-lists-lineitem-and-textlineitem-update-actions/#how-addedat-will-be-compared","text":"In commercetools shopping lists API, there is no update action to change the addedAt field of the LineItem and TextLineItem , also in API it has a default value described as Defaults to the current date and time. , when it's not set in the draft, so how to compare and update this field? Proposed solution: The addedAt field will be synced only if the value provided in the line item draft, otherwise, the addedAt value will be omitted.

The customObject will have a container: \"commercetools-sync-java.UnresolvedReferencesService.categoryDrafts\" and a key representing the key of the category Drafts that is waiting to be created/updated. Here is an example of a CustomObject in the target project that represents a category Draft with the key categoryKey1 . Being persisted as CustomObject means that the referenced parent Category with the key nonExistingParent does not exist yet. { \"id\" : \"81dcb42f-1959-4412-a4bb-8ad420d0d11f\" , \"version\" : 1 , \"createdAt\" : \"2021-01-13T12:19:45.937Z\" , \"lastModifiedAt\" : \"2021-01-13T12:19:45.937Z\" , \"lastModifiedBy\" : { \"clientId\" : \"7OSAGVPscneW_KS4nqskFkrd\" , \"isPlatformClient\" : false }, \"createdBy\" : { \"clientId\" : \"7OSAGVPscneW_KS4nqskFkrd\" , \"isPlatformClient\" : false }, \"container\" : \"commercetools-sync-java.UnresolvedReferencesService.categoryDrafts\" , \"key\" : \"8732a63fa8ca457e86f4075340d65154e7e2476a\" , \"value\" : { \"missingReferencedKeys\" : [ \"nonExistingParent\" ], \"waitingDraft\" : { \"custom\" : { \"type\" : { \"key\" : \"oldCategoryCustomTypeKey\" }, \"fields\" : { \"backgroundColor\" : { \"de\" : \"rot\" , \"en\" : \"red\" }, \"invisibleInShop\" : false } }, \"key\" : \"categoryKey1\" , \"name\" : { \"en\" : \"furniture\" }, \"parent\" : { \"key\" : \"nonExistingParent\" }, \"slug\" : { \"en\" : \"new-furniture1\" } } } } As soon, as the referenced parent Category draft is supplied to the sync, the draft will be created/updated and the CustomObject will be removed from the target project. Syncing from a commercetools project \u00b6 When syncing from a source commercetools project, you can use toCategoryDrafts method that transforms(resolves by querying and caching key-id pairs) and maps from a Category to CategoryDraft using cache in order to make them ready for reference resolution by the sync, for example: // Build a CategoryQuery for fetching categories from a source CTP project without any references expanded for the sync: final CategoryQuery categoryQuery = CategoryQuery . of (); // Query all categories (NOTE this is just for example, please adjust your logic) final List < Category > categories = CtpQueryUtils . queryAll ( sphereClient , categoryQuery , Function . identity ()) . thenApply ( fetchedResources -> fetchedResources . stream () . flatMap ( List :: stream ) . collect ( Collectors . toList ())) . toCompletableFuture () . join (); In order to transform and map the Category to CategoryDraft , Utils method toCategoryDrafts requires sphereClient , implementation of ReferenceIdToKeyCache and categories as parameters. For cache implementation, You can use your own cache implementation or use the class in the library - which implements the cache using caffeine library with an LRU (Least Recently Used) based cache eviction strategy CaffeineReferenceIdToKeyCacheImpl . Example as shown below: //Implement the cache using library class. final ReferenceIdToKeyCache referenceIdToKeyCache = new CaffeineReferenceIdToKeyCacheImpl (); //For every reference fetch its key using id, cache it and map from Category to CategoryDraft. With help of the cache same reference keys can be reused. CompletableFuture < List < CategoryDraft >> categoryDrafts = CategoryTransformUtils . toCategoryDrafts ( client , referenceIdToKeyCache , categories ); Syncing from an external resource \u00b6 When syncing from an external resource, ResourceIdentifier s with their key s have to be supplied as following example: final CategoryDraft categoryDraft = CategoryDraftBuilder . of ( ofEnglish ( \"name\" ), ofEnglish ( \"slug\" )) . parent ( ResourceIdentifier . ofKey ( \"parent-category-key\" )) // note that parent provided with key . custom ( CustomFieldsDraft . ofTypeKeyAndJson ( \"type-key\" , emptyMap ())) // note that custom type provided with key . assets ( singletonList ( AssetDraftBuilder . of ( emptyList (), LocalizedString . ofEnglish ( \"asset-name\" )) . custom ( CustomFieldsDraft . ofTypeKeyAndJson ( \"type-key\" , emptyMap ())) // note that custom type provided with key . key ( \"asset-key\" ) . build () )) . build (); SyncOptions \u00b6 After the sphereClient is set up, a CategorySyncOptions should be built as follows: // instantiating a CategorySyncOptions final CategorySyncOptions categorySyncOptions = CategorySyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). build (); SyncOptions is an object which provides a place for users to add certain configurations to customize the sync process. Available configurations: errorCallback \u00b6 A callback that is called whenever an error event occurs during the sync process. Each resource executes its own error-callback. When sync process of particular resource runs successfully, it is not triggered. It contains the following context about the error-event: sync exception category draft from the source category of the target project (only provided if an existing category could be found) the update-actions, which failed (only provided if an existing category could be found) final Logger logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( CategorySync . class ); final CategorySyncOptions categorySyncOptions = CategorySyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ) . errorCallback (( syncException , draft , category , updateActions ) -> logger . error ( new SyncException ( \"My customized message\" ), syncException )). build (); warningCallback \u00b6 A callback that is called whenever a warning event occurs during the sync process. Each resource executes its own warning-callback. When sync process of particular resource runs successfully, it is not triggered. It contains the following context about the warning message: sync exception category draft from the source category of the target project (only provided if an existing category could be found) final Logger logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( CategorySync . class ); final CategorySyncOptions categorySyncOptions = CategorySyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ) . warningCallback (( syncException , draft , category , updateActions ) -> logger . warn ( new SyncException ( \"My customized message\" ), syncException )). build (); beforeUpdateCallback \u00b6 During the sync process if a target category and a category draft are matched, this callback can be used to intercept the update request just before it is sent to commercetools platform. This allows the user to modify update actions array with custom actions or discard unwanted actions. The callback provides the following information : category draft from the source category from the target project update actions that were calculated after comparing both final TriFunction < List < UpdateAction < Category >> , CategoryDraft , Category , List < UpdateAction < Category >>> beforeUpdateCategoryCallback = ( updateActions , newCategoryDraft , oldCategory ) -> updateActions . stream () . filter ( updateAction -> !

It contains following information : category draft that should be created Please refer to example in product sync document . batchSize \u00b6 A number that could be used to set the batch size with which categories are fetched and processed, as categories are obtained from the target project on commercetools platform in batches for better performance. The algorithm accumulates up to batchSize resources from the input list, then fetches the corresponding categories from the target project on commecetools platform in a single request. Playing with this option can slightly improve or reduce processing speed. If it is not set, the default batch size is 50 for category sync. final CategorySyncOptions categorySyncOptions = CategorySyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). batchSize ( 30 ). build (); cacheSize \u00b6 In the service classes of the commercetools-sync-java library, we have implemented an in-memory LRU cache to store a map used for the reference resolution of the library. The cache reduces the reference resolution based calls to the commercetools API as the required fields of a resource will be fetched only one time. This cached fields then might be used by another resource referencing the already resolved resource instead of fetching from commercetools API. It turns out, having the in-memory LRU cache will improve overall performance of the sync library and commercetools API. which will improve the overall performance of the sync and commercetools API. Playing with this option can change the memory usage of the library. If it is not set, the default cache size is 10.000 for category sync. final CategorySyncOptions categorySyncOptions = CategorySyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). cacheSize ( 5000 ). build (); Running the sync \u00b6 After all the aforementioned points in the previous section have been fulfilled, to run the sync: // instantiating a category sync final CategorySync categorySync = new CategorySync ( categorySyncOptions ); // execute the sync on your list of categories CompletionStage < CategorySyncStatistics > syncStatisticsStage = categorySync . sync ( categoryDrafts ); The result of the completing the syncStatisticsStage in the previous code snippet contains a CategorySyncStatistics which contains all the stats of the sync process; which includes a report message, the total number of updated, created, failed, processed categories and the processing time of the last sync batch in different time units and in a human-readable format. final CategorySyncStatistics stats = syncStatisticsStage . toCompletebleFuture (). join (); stats . getReportMessage (); /*\"Summary: 2000 categories were processed in total (1000 created, 995 updated, 5 failed to sync and 0 categories with a missing parent).\"*/ Note The statistics object contains the processing time of the last batch only. This is due to two reasons: The sync processing time should not take into account the time between supplying batches to the sync. It is not known by the sync which batch is going to be the last one supplied. More examples of how to use the sync \u00b6 Sync from another CTP project as a source . Sync from an external source . Make sure to read the Important Usage Tips for optimal performance. Build all update actions \u00b6 A utility method provided by the library to compare a Category with a new CategoryDraft and results in a list of category update actions.

This can be done by decorating the sphereClient with QueueSphereClientDecorator Retry on 5xx errors with a retry strategy. This can be achieved by decorating the sphereClient with the RetrySphereClientDecorator If you have no special requirements on the sphere client creation, then you can use the ClientConfigurationUtils#createClient util which applies the best practices for SphereClient creation. Tuning the Sync Process \u00b6 The sync library is not meant to be executed in a parallel fashion. For example: final ProductSync productSync = new ProductSync ( syncOptions ); final CompletableFuture < ProductSyncStatistics > syncFuture1 = productSync . sync ( batch1 ). toCompletableFuture (); final CompletableFuture < ProductSyncStatistics > syncFuture2 = productSync . sync ( batch2 ). toCompletableFuture (); CompletableFuture . allOf ( syncFuture1 , syncFuture2 ). join ; The aforementioned example demonstrates how the library should NOT be used. The library, however, should be instead used in a sequential fashion: final ProductSync productSync = new ProductSync ( syncOptions ); productSync . sync ( batch1 ) . thenCompose ( result -> productSync . sync ( batch2 )) . toCompletableFuture () . join (); By design, scaling the sync process should not be done by executing the batches themselves in parallel. However, it can be done either by: Changing the number of max parallel requests within the sphereClient configuration.

Reference Resolution \u00b6 In commercetools, a reference can be created by providing the key instead of the ID with the type ResourceIdentifier . When the reference key is provided with a ResourceIdentifier , the sync will resolve the resource with the given key and use the ID of the found resource to create or update a reference. Therefore, in order to resolve the actual ids of those references in the sync process, ResourceIdentifier s with their key s have to be supplied.

The algorithm accumulates up to batchSize resources from the input list, then fetches the corresponding product projections from the target project on the commecetools platform in a single request. Playing with this option can slightly improve or reduce processing speed. If it is not set, the default batch size is 30 for product sync. final ProductSyncOptions productSyncOptions = ProductSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). batchSize ( 50 ). build (); cacheSize \u00b6 In the service classes of the commercetools-sync-java library, we have implemented an in-memory LRU cache to store a map used for the reference resolution of the library. The cache reduces the reference resolution based calls to the commercetools API as the required fields of a resource will be fetched only one time. These cached fields then might be used by another resource referencing the already resolved resource instead of fetching from commercetools API. It turns out, having the in-memory LRU cache will improve the overall performance of the sync library and commercetools API. which will improve the overall performance of the sync and commercetools API. Playing with this option can change the memory usage of the library. If it is not set, the default cache size is 10.000 for product sync. final ProductSyncOptions productSyncOptions = ProductSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). cacheSize ( 5000 ). build (); syncFilter \u00b6 It represents either a blacklist or a whitelist for filtering certain update action groups. Blacklisting an update action group means that everything in products will be synced except for any group in the blacklist. A typical use case is to blacklist prices when syncing product projections. In other words, syncing everything in product projections except for prices. final ProductSyncOptions syncOptions = syncOptionsBuilder . syncFilter ( ofBlackList ( ActionGroup . PRICES )). build (); Whitelisting an update action group means that the groups in this whitelist will be the only group synced in products. One use case could be to whitelist prices when syncing products. In other words, syncing prices only in product projections and nothing else. final ProductSyncOptions syncOptions = syncOptionsBuilder . syncFilter ( ofWhiteList ( ActionGroup . PRICES )). build (); The list of action groups allowed to be blacklisted or whitelisted on product projections can be found here . ensureChannels \u00b6 A flag to indicate whether the sync process should create a price channel of the given key when it doesn't exist in a target project yet. - If ensureChannels is set to false this products won't be synced and the errorCallback will be triggered. - If ensureChannels is set to true the sync will attempt to create the missing channel with the given key. If it fails to create the price channel, the products won't sync and errorCallback will be triggered. - If not provided, it is set to false by default. final ProductSyncOptions productSyncOptions = ProductSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). ensureChannels ( true ). build (); Running the sync \u00b6 After all the aforementioned points in the previous section have been fulfilled, to run the sync: // instantiating a product sync final ProductSync productSync = new ProductSync ( productSyncOptions ); // execute the sync on your list of products CompletionStage < ProductSyncStatistics > syncStatisticsStage = productSync . sync ( productDrafts ); The result of completing the syncStatisticsStage in the previous code snippet contains a ProductSyncStatistics which contains all the stats of the sync process; which includes a report message, the total number of updated, created, failed, processed products and the processing time of the sync in different time units and in a human-readable format. final ProductSyncStatistics stats = syncStatisticsStage . toCompletebleFuture (). join (); stats . getReportMessage (); /*Summary: 2000 product(s) were processed in total (1000 created, 995 updated, 5 failed to sync and 0 product(s) with missing reference(s)).*/ Note The statistics object contains the processing time of the last batch only. This is due to two reasons: The sync processing time should not take into account the time between supplying batches to the sync. It is not known by the sync which batch is going to be the last one supplied. Persistence of ProductDrafts with Irresolvable References \u00b6 A productDraft X could be supplied in with an attribute referencing productDraft Y. It could be that Y is not supplied before X, which means the sync could fail to create/updating X. It could also be that Y is not supplied at all in this batch but at a later batch. The library keeps tracks of such \"referencing\" drafts like X and persists them in storage ( Commercetools platform customObjects in the target project , in this case) to keep them and create/update them accordingly whenever the referenced drafts exist in the target project. The customObject will have a container: \"commercetools-sync-java.UnresolvedReferencesService.productDrafts\" and a key representing the key of the productDraft that is waiting to be created/updated. Here is an example of a CustomObject in the target project that represents a productDraft with productKey1 . It being persisted as CustomObject means that the referenced productDrafts with keys foo and bar do not exist yet. { \"id\" : \"d0fbb69e-76e7-4ec0-893e-3aaab6f4f6b6\" , \"version\" : 1 , \"container\" : \"commercetools-sync-java.UnresolvedReferencesService.productDrafts\" , \"key\" : \"productKey1\" , \"value\" : { \"dependantProductKeys\" : [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ], \"productDraft\" : { \"productType\" : { \"typeId\" : \"product-type\" , \"id\" : \"main-product-type\" }, \"masterVariant\" : { \"id\" : 1 , \"sku\" : \"white-shirt-1\" , \"key\" : \"white-shirt-1\" , \"prices\" : [], \"images\" : [], \"attributes\" : [ { \"name\" : \"product-reference-set\" , \"value\" : [ { \"typeId\" : \"product\" , \"id\" : \"foo\" }, { \"typeId\" : \"product\" , \"id\" : \"bar\" } ] } ] }, \"key\" : \"productKey1\" } }, \"createdAt\" : \"2019-09-27T13:45:35.495Z\" , \"lastModifiedAt\" : \"2019-09-27T13:45:35.495Z\" , \"lastModifiedBy\" : { \"clientId\" : \"8bV3XSW-taCpi873-GQTa8lf\" , \"isPlatformClient\" : false }, \"createdBy\" : { \"clientId\" : \"8bV3XSW-taCpi873-GQTa8lf\" , \"isPlatformClient\" : false } } As soon, as the referenced productDrafts are supplied to the sync, the draft will be created/updated and the CustomObject will be removed from the target project. Keeping the old custom objects around forever can negatively influence the performance of your project and the time it takes to restore it from a backup. Deleting unused data ensures the best performance for your project. Please have a look into the Cleanup guide to cleanup old unresolved custom objects.

Syncing products with cyclic dependencies are not supported yet. An example of a cyclic dependency is a product a which references a product b and at the same time product b references product a . Cycles can contain more than 2 products. For example: a -> b -> c -> a . If there are such cycles, the sync will consider all the products in the cycle as products with missing parents.

Syncing from a commercetools project \u00b6 When syncing from a source commercetools project, you can use toProductTypeDrafts method that transforms(resolves by querying and caching key-id pairs) and maps from a ProductType to ProductTypeDraft . It can be configured to use a cache that will speed up the reference resolution performed during the sync, for example: // Build a ProductTypeQuery for fetching product types from a source CTP project without any references expanded for the sync. final ProductTypeQuery productTypeQuery = ProductTypeQuery . of (); // Query all productTypes (NOTE this is just for example, please adjust your logic) final List < ProductType > productTypes = CtpQueryUtils . queryAll ( sphereClient , productTypeQuery , Function . identity ()) . thenApply ( fetchedResources -> fetchedResources . stream () . flatMap ( List :: stream ) . collect ( Collectors . toList ())) . toCompletableFuture () . join (); In order to transform and map the ProductType to ProductTypeDraft , Utils method toProductTypeDrafts requires sphereClient , implementation of ReferenceIdToKeyCache and productTypes as parameters. For cache implementation, You can use your own cache implementation or use the class in the library - which implements the cache using caffeine library with an LRU (Least Recently Used) based cache eviction strategy CaffeineReferenceIdToKeyCacheImpl . Example as shown below: //Implement the cache using library class. final ReferenceIdToKeyCache referenceIdToKeyCache = new CaffeineReferenceIdToKeyCacheImpl (); //For every reference fetch its key using id, cache it and map from ProductType to ProductTypeDraft. With help of the cache same reference keys can be reused. CompletableFuture < List < ProductTypeDraft >> productTypeDrafts = ProductTransformUtils . toProductTypeDrafts ( client , referenceIdToKeyCache , productTypes ); Syncing from an external resource \u00b6 Variant attributes with type NestedType do not support the ResourceIdentifier yet, for those references you have to provide the key value on the id field of the reference. This means that calling getId() on the reference should return its key . final AttributeDefinitionDraft nestedTypeAttr = AttributeDefinitionDraftBuilder . of ( AttributeDefinitionBuilder . of ( \"nestedattr\" , ofEnglish ( \"nestedattr\" ), NestedAttributeType . of ( ProductType . referenceOfId ( \"product-type-key\" ))) // note that key is provided in the id field of reference . build ()) . build (); final AttributeDefinitionDraft setOfNestedTypeAttr = AttributeDefinitionDraftBuilder . of ( AttributeDefinitionBuilder . of ( \"setofNestedAttr\" , ofEnglish ( \"setofNestedAttr\" ), SetAttributeType . of ( NestedAttributeType . of ( ProductType . referenceOfId ( \"product-type-key\" )))) . build ()) . searchable ( false ) . build (); final ProductTypeDraft productTypeDraft = ProductTypeDraftBuilder . of ( \"key\" , \"foo\" , \"description\" , Arrays . asList ( nestedTypeAttr , setOfNestedTypeAttr )) . build (); SyncOptions \u00b6 After the sphereClient is setup, a ProductTypeSyncOptions should be built as follows: // instantiating a ProductTypeSyncOptions final ProductTypeSyncOptions productTypeSyncOptions = ProductTypeSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). build (); SyncOptions is an object which provides a place for users to add certain configurations to customize the sync process. Available configurations: errorCallback \u00b6 A callback that is called whenever an error event occurs during the sync process. Each resource executes its own error-callback. When the sync process of a particular resource runs successfully, it is not triggered. It contains the following context about the error-event: sync exception product type draft from the source product type of the target project (only provided if an existing product type could be found) the update-actions, which failed (only provided if an existing product type could be found) final Logger logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( ProductTypeSync . class ); final ProductTypeSyncOptions productTypeSyncOptions = ProductTypeSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ) . errorCallback (( syncException , draft , productType , updateActions ) -> logger . error ( new SyncException ( \"My customized message\" ), syncException )). build (); warningCallback \u00b6 A callback is called whenever a warning event occurs during the sync process. Each resource executes its own warning-callback. When the sync process of a particular resource runs successfully, it is not triggered. It contains the following context about the warning message: sync exception product type draft from the source product type of the target project (only provided if an existing product type could be found) final Logger logger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( ProductTypeSync . class ); final ProductTypeSyncOptions productTypeSyncOptions = ProductTypeSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ) . warningCallback (( syncException , draft , productType , updateActions ) -> logger . warn ( new SyncException ( \"My customized message\" ), syncException )). build (); beforeUpdateCallback \u00b6 During the sync process, if a target product type and a product type draft are matched, this callback can be used to intercept the update request just before it is sent to the commercetools platform. This allows the user to modify update actions array with custom actions or discard unwanted actions. The callback provides the following information : product type draft from the source product type from the target project update actions that were calculated after comparing both final TriFunction < List < UpdateAction < ProductType >> , ProductTypeDraft , ProductType , List < UpdateAction < ProductType >>> beforeUpdateProductTypeCallback = ( updateActions , newProductTypeDraft , oldProductType ) -> updateActions . stream () . filter ( updateAction -> ! ( updateAction instanceof RemoveAttributeDefinition )) . collect ( Collectors . toList ()); final ProductTypeSyncOptions productTypeSyncOptions = ProductTypeSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). beforeUpdateCallback ( beforeUpdateProductTypeCallback ). build (); beforeCreateCallback \u00b6 During the sync process, if a product type draft should be created, this callback can be used to intercept the create request just before it is sent to the commercetools platform. It contains the following information : product type draft that should be created Please refer to example in product sync document . batchSize \u00b6 A number that could be used to set the batch size with which product types are fetched and processed, as product types are obtained from the target project on the commercetools platform in batches for better performance. The algorithm accumulates up to batchSize resources from the input list, then fetches the corresponding product types from the target project on the commecetools platform in a single request. Playing with this option can slightly improve or reduce processing speed. If it is not set, the default batch size is 50 for product type sync. final ProductTypeSyncOptions productTypeSyncOptions = ProductTypeSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). batchSize ( 30 ). build (); cacheSize \u00b6 In the service classes of the commercetools-sync-java library, we have implemented an in-memory LRU cache to store a map used for the reference resolution of the library. The cache reduces the reference resolution based calls to the commercetools API as the required fields of a resource will be fetched only one time. These cached fields then might be used by another resource referencing the already resolved resource instead of fetching from commercetools API. It turns out, having the in-memory LRU cache will improve the overall performance of the sync library and commercetools API. which will improve the overall performance of the sync and commercetools API. Playing with this option can change the memory usage of the library. If it is not set, the default cache size is 10.000 for product type sync. final ProductTypeSyncOptions productTypeSyncOptions = ProductTypeSyncOptionsBuilder . of ( sphereClient ). cacheSize ( 5000 ). build (); Running the sync \u00b6 After all the aforementioned points in the previous section have been fulfilled, to run the sync: // instantiating a product type sync final ProductTypeSync productTypeSync = new ProductTypeSync ( productTypeSyncOptions ); // execute the sync on your list of product types CompletionStage < ProductTypeSyncStatistics > syncStatisticsStage = productTypeSync . sync ( productTypeDrafts ); The result of completing the syncStatisticsStage in the previous code snippet contains a ProductTypeSyncStatistics which contains all the stats of the sync process; which includes a report message, the total number of updated, created, failed, processed product types and the processing time of the last sync batch in different time units and in a human-readable format. final ProductTypeSyncStatistics stats = syncStatisticsStage . toCompletebleFuture (). join (); stats . getReportMessage (); /*\"Summary: 2000 products types were processed in total (1000 created, 995 updated, 5 failed to sync).\"*/ Note The statistics object contains the processing time of the last batch only. This is due to two reasons: The sync processing time should not take into account the time between supplying batches to the sync. It is not known by the sync which batch is going to be the last one supplied. Important to Note \u00b6 If two matching attributeDefinition s (old and new) on the matching productType s (old and new) have a different AttributeType , the sync will remove the existing attributeDefinition and then add a new attributeDefinition with the new AttributeType . The attributeDefinition for which the AttributeType is not defined ( null ) will not be synced. More examples of how to use the sync \u00b6 Sync from another CTP project as a source . Sync from an external source . Make sure to read the Important Usage Tips for optimal performance. Build all update actions \u00b6 A utility method provided by the library to compare a ProductType with a new ProductTypeDraft and results in a list of product type update actions.

Syncing from a commercetools project \u00b6 When syncing from a source commercetools project, you can use toShoppingListDrafts method that transforms(resolves by querying and caching key-id pairs) and maps from a ShoppingList to ShoppingListDraft using cache in order to make them ready for reference resolution by the sync, for example: // Build a ShoppingListQuery for fetching shopping lists from a source CTP project without any references expanded for the sync: final ShoppingListQuery shoppingListQuery = ShoppingListReferenceResolutionUtils . buildShoppingListQuery (); // Query all shopping lists (NOTE this is just for example, please adjust your logic) final List < ShoppingList > shoppingLists = CtpQueryUtils . queryAll ( sphereClient , shoppingListQuery , Function . identity ()) . thenApply ( fetchedResources -> fetchedResources . stream () . flatMap ( List :: stream ) . collect ( Collectors . toList ())) . toCompletableFuture () . join (); In order to transform and map the ShoppingList to ShoppingListDraft , Utils method toShoppingListDrafts requires sphereClient , implementation of ReferenceIdToKeyCache and shoppingLists as parameters. For cache implementation, You can use your own cache implementation or use the class in the library - which implements the cache using caffeine library with an LRU (Least Recently Used) based cache eviction strategy CaffeineReferenceIdToKeyCacheImpl .

This is due to two reasons: The sync processing time should not take into account the time between supplying batches to the sync. It is not known by the sync which batch is going to be the last one supplied. Persistence of StateDrafts with missing references \u00b6 A StateDraft (state-A) could be supplied with a transition referencing StateDraft (state-B). It could be that (state-B) is not supplied before (state-A), which means the sync could fail to create/update (state-A). It could also be that (state-B) is not supplied at all in this batch but at a later batch. The library keeps tracks of such \"referencing\" states like (state-A) and persists them in storage ( commercetools customObjects in the target project , in this case) to keep them and create/update them accordingly whenever the referenced state has been provided at some point. The customObject will have a container: \"commercetools-sync-java.UnresolvedTransitionsService.stateDrafts\" and a key representing a hash value of the StateDraft key that is waiting to be created/updated. Here is an example of a CustomObject in the target project that represents a StateDraft with key state-A . It being persisted as CustomObject means that the referenced StateDrafts with keys state-B do not exist yet. { \"container\" : \"commercetools-sync-java.UnresolvedTransitionsService.stateDrafts\" , \"key\" : \"518ea82bb78755c0cdd67909dd3206d56186f7e5\" , \"value\" : { \"missingTransitionStateKeys\" : [ \"state-B\" ], \"stateDraft\" : { \"type\" : \"ReviewState\" , \"transitions\" : [ { \"id\" : \"state-B\" , \"typeId\" : \"state\" } ], \"roles\" : [ \"ReviewIncludedInStatistics\" ], \"key\" : \"state-A\" , \"initial\" : true } } } As soon, as the referenced StateDrafts are supplied to the sync, the draft will be created/updated and the CustomObject will be removed from the target project. Keeping the old custom objects around forever can negatively influence the performance of your project and the time it takes to restore it from a backup. Deleting unused data ensures the best performance for your project. Please have a look into the Cleanup guide to cleanup old unresolved custom objects.
