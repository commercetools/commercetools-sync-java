# commercetools inventory sync

Utility which provides API for building CTP inventory update actions and inventory synchronisation.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Under the hood](#under-the-hood)


## Usage

### Build all update actions

<!-- TODO: Probably #14 affects inventory sync as well. Ensure before providing the code snippet. -->

### Build particular update action(s)

To build the update action for changing inventory quantity:

````java
final Optional<UpdateAction<InventoryEntry>> updateAction = buildChangeQuantityAction(oldInventory, inventoryDraft);
````

For other examples of update actions, please check [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/utils/InventoryUpdateActionUtilsItTest.java).

### Sync list of inventory entry drafts

In order to use the inventory sync an instance of
[InventorySyncOptions](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncOptions.java)
has to be injected.

In order to instantiate a `InventorySyncOptions`, a `sphereClient` is required:

````java
// instantiating an InventorySyncOptions
final InventorySyncOptions inventorySyncOptions = InventorySyncOptionsBuilder.of(sphereClient).build();
````

then to start the sync:

````java
// instantiating an inventory sync
final InventorySync inventorySync = new InventorySync(inventorySyncOptions);

// execute the sync on your list of inventories
inventorySync.sync(inventoryEntryDrafts);
````

**Note:** We encourage you to use `QueueSphereClientDecorator` as `sphereClient` implementation. It will reduce amount
of concurrent requests to CTP, thus will improve its performance. An example of use can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncItTest.java#L345).

**Preconditions:** The sync expects a list of `InventoryEntryDraft` objects that have their `sku` fields set,
otherwise the sync will trigger an `errorCallback` function set by the user (more on it can be found down below in the options explanations).
Every inventory entry may have a reference to a supply `Channel` and a reference to the `Type` of its custom fields. These
references are matched by their `key`. Therefore, in order for the sync to resolve the actual ids of those references,
their `key`s has to be supplied in one of two ways:
- Provide the `key` value on the `id` field of the reference. This means that calling `getId()` on the
reference would return its `key`. Note that the library will check that this `key` is not
provided in `UUID` format by default. However, if you want to provide the `key` in `UUID` format, you can
set it through the sync options. Different example of sync performed that way can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncTest.java#L160).
- Provide the reference expanded. This means that calling `getObj()` on the reference should not return `null`,
but return the actual object complete object of the reference, from which the its `key` can be directly accessible.
Example of sync performed that way can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncTest.java#L123).

The sync results in a `CompletionStage` that contains an `InventorySyncStatistics` object. This object contains all
the stats of the sync process: a report message, the total number of updated, created, failed, processed inventory entries
and the processing time of the sync in different time units and in a human readable format. An example of how it looks like can be found
[here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncItTest.java#L366).

<!-- TODO: Update above after resolving #23 -->
<!-- TODO: Consider if getStatistics() is needed. Express your doubts in a #23 -->
````java
inventorySync.sync(inventoryEntryDrafts)
            .thenAccept(inventorySyncStatistics -> inventorySyncStatistics.getReportMessage());
//"Summary: 2000 inventory entries were processed in total (1000 created, 995 updated, 5 failed to sync)"
````

Additional optional configuration for the sync can be configured on the `InventorySyncOptions` instance, according to your need:

- `ensureChannels`
a flag which represents a strategy to handle syncing inventory entries with missing supply channels.
Having an inventory entry, with a missing supply channel reference, could be processed in either of the following ways:
    - If `ensureChannels` is set to `false` this inventory entry won't be synced and the `errorCallback` will be triggered.
    An example of use can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncItTest.java#L301).
    - If `ensureChannels` is set to `true` the sync will attempt to create the missing channel with the given key.
      If it fails to create the supply channel, the inventory entry won't sync and `errorCallback` will be triggered.
      An example of use can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncItTest.java#L284).
    - If not provided, it is set to `false` by default.

- `batchSize`
a number that could be used to set the batch size with which inventory entries are fetched and processed with,
as inventory entries are obtained from the target CTP project in batches for better performance. The algorithm accumulates up to
`batchSize` inventory entries from the input list, then fetches the corresponding inventory entries from the target CTP project
in a single request, and then performs the update actions needed. Playing with this option can slightly improve or reduce processing speed.
An example of use can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncItTest.java#L318).
    - If not provided, it is set to `30` by default.

- `errorCallBack`
a callback that is called whenever an event occurs during the sync process that represents an error.
An example of use can be found [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sync-java/blob/master/src/integration-test/java/com/commercetools/sync/inventories/InventorySyncItTest.java#L391).

- `warningCallBack`
a callback that is called whenever an event occurs during the sync process that represents a warning.

- `removeOtherLocales`
a flag which enables the sync module to add additional localizations without deleting existing ones, if set to `false`.
If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing object properties.

- `removeOtherSetEntries`
a flag which enables the sync module to add additional Set entries without deleting existing ones, if set to `false`.
If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing Set entries.

- `removeOtherCollectionEntries`
a flag which enables the sync module to add collection (e.g. Assets, Images etc.) entries without deleting existing
ones, if set to `false`. If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing collection
entries.

- `removeOtherProperties`
a flag which enables the sync module to add additional object properties (e.g. custom fields, etc..) without deleting
existing ones, if set to `false`. If set to `true`, which is the default value of the option, it deletes the existing
object properties.

- `allowUuid`
a flag, if set to `true`, enables the user to use keys with UUID format for references. By default, it is set to `false`.

<!-- TODO Update above options with links to tests. Tests should be written when inventory sync could actually use them (when custom update actions would use them).  -->

## Under the hood

The tool matches categories by their `sku` and `supplyChannel` key. Based on that inventories are created or updated.
Currently the tool does not support inventory deletion.
